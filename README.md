# AWSome IoT Prototyping Day for INTTRA

Today we will build a completely functional, end-to-end IoT prototype of an asset tracking system using the **ESP32 HiLetGo** development board ([Find it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo%C2%AE-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated/dp/B0718T232Z)).

![ESP32 HiLetGo](img/esp32-hiletgo.jpg)

. Here are some specs:
- Hybrid Wifi/Bluetooth Chip. ESP32 can interface with other systems to provide Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality through its SPI / SDIO or I2C / UART interfaces.
- Built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management.
- ESP32 achieves ultra-low power consumption with a combination of several types of proprietary software
- ESP32 is capable of functioning reliably in industrial environments, with an operating temperature ranging from –40°C to +125°C.

We will use **AWS** to collect, store and visualize the data from the devices. The map-based dashboard will listen for state changes to the device shadow and update in near real time. Secondly, all transactions will be stored in a blockchain ledger, to provide users a definitive, unalterable history of transactions. This means, they will be able to confirm with certainty the path their shipment took (GPS Sensors), that the shipment was not tampered with (light and motion sensors) and it met environmental requirements (temperature and humidity sensors). The centralized blockchain solution we will use is **Hyperledger Sawtooth on AWS**.

## Pre-requisites

### AWS Environment

Before getting started, make sure you have access to an AWS account and have the AWS CLI installed on your development machine.

- Simple AWS CLI installation with PIP: `pip install awscli --upgrade --user`
- Windows installers: [64bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.msi) | [32bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32.msi)

*Complete guide to installing the CLI:*

## Device Setup & Configuration

In this section, we will flash the operating system, tweak some settings and provision the device with certificates to connect to AWS.

### Flash the Device OS

- Connect to your ESP32 via your micro usb cable.
- Choose your ESP32 device and click **Select**.
  ![](img/choose-device.jpg)

- Be sure *esp32* is the selected platform and *demo-js* is the selected app and click **Flash**.
  ![](img/flash-device.jpg)

- Configure your WiFi settings by entering the WiFi network SSD and password and click **Set**.
  ![](img/configure-device-wifi.jpg)
- After applying these settings click **Done**.
- You should now see rotating log messages, 'Tick' and 'Tock' in the demo application.

### Wire up your ESP with sensors. 

The example application uses both a GPS module (SIM28) that will return both altitude and geocoordinates and a digital temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22). This is what it should look like once complete:

  ![](img/device.jpg)

Note: If this is your first time using a breadboard, check out [this article](https://learn.adafruit.com/lesson-0-getting-started/breadboard) for some more background.

### Replace App Files
- Replace the default device **mos.yml** file from the dropdown menu with the code from **device/mos.yml**.
    - Click the *Save file, copy to device, reboot device (fast)* button after replacing the default YAML file.
    ![](img/mos-upload.jpg)

- Replace the default device **init.js** file from the dropdown menu with the code from **device/init.js**.
    - Click the *Save file, copy to device, reboot device (fast)* button after replacing the default Javascript file.
    ![](img/init-upload.jpg)

### Connect to AWS
- Navigate to the left-hand column of the Mongoose OS configuration window and click **Device Config**.

- Leave the *AWS region* box blank or select the region you would prefer and create a permissive policy automatically by typing *mos-default* in the AWS policy box.

- Click **Provision with AWS IoT** to provision this device.

- After this completes click **Save Configuration**.


### You're Set!

After completing all of these steps, data from the ESP32 device shadow should be displaying in the Device Logs:
```
[Jun 15 16:14:19.101] mgos_aws_shadow_ev   Update: {"state": {"reported": {"humidity":null,"temperature":null,"gps":"$GPGGA,005012.798,,,,,0,0,,,M,,M,,*48\r\n$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E\r\n$GPGSV,1,1,00*79\r\n$GPRMC,005012.798,V,,,,,0.00,0.00,060180,

```
## Building the Web Application

### Set up Cognito Identity Pool

For the subscribing web application, we will be creating a Cognito Identity Pool to authenticate and authorize the end user to get data from our endpoint.

1. Open the **Amazon Cognito** Console.
2. Click **Manage Federated Identities**
![](img/cognito-front.png)
> **What is Cognito User Pools?**
> There are two flavours of Cognito. User Pools enables you to create and manage your own directory of users for your application. Federated Identities leverages an external indentity provider like Sign-in with Amazon, Facebook Login, Sign-in with Google, Twitter or any OpenID compatible directory.

3. Click **Create new identity pool**. Name your identity pool and check the box *Enable access to unauthenticated identities*.
![](img/cognito-create-identity-pool.png)
4. Click the dropdown for **Authentication Providers**. Note the different options you have here. You could link up a *Cognito User Pool*, or use one of the popular identity providers mentioned. For this bootcamp, we will not need to set this up.
5. Press **Create Pool**.
6. Next, it will bring us to a screen where we can setup the IAM roles that will be assumed by both an *Unauthenticated User* and an *Authenticated User*. Look at the policy documents to see how they are structured. Then press **Allow**.
7. The final step is to give permission to an *Unauthenticated User* to subscribe to our AWS IoT Topic. To do this, click back to the list of AWS Services and open the **AWS Identity & Access Management Console**.
8. On the left menu, click **Roles**.
9. You will see all of your roles here. There is one role titled **Cognito_<YOUR_APP_NAME>UnauthRole**. Click on this role.
10. Under *Inline Policies*, press **Create Role Policy** to create a new inline IAM policy.
![](img/iam-permissions.png)
11. Select the box **Custom Policy** and press **Select**.
![](img/iam-create-new-policy.png)
12. Name the policy and copy and paste the following JSON text. **Remember to replace <REPLACE_WITH_ACCOUNT_NUMBER> with your actual account number**.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect",
                "iot:Receive"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:<REGION>:<REPLACE_WITH_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:topicfilter/sbs/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

> **Note:** Replace *<REPLACE_WITH_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>* with your actual account number and *<REGION>* with the region you are using.

13. Press **Apply Policy** and you are done!

**Congratulations! You have successfully created your Cognito Identity Pool**
